          There are many misconceptions regarding Tesla's inventions, his feud with Thomas Edison and the conflict of AC and DC. Such proclaiments conclude a sole 'father' of inventions and in reality, it is a rarity that when an invention comes to light, it is often in the form of its intended use. The practical result entails the minds of many individuals, whose work is often unrecognised. Subsequently, this tribute page was designed to encourage one to look beyond the individual society recognises as the 'inventor', but to appreciate the work of the community. Following a short tale of Tesla's history, I have chosen to focus the history of Alternating Current (AC) for the reason that Tesla's <b>contribution</b> was one of many, yet he is mistakenly known to have invented it. 
           </p><p>I hope readers do not proclaim Tesla to be a victim of Edison's entrepreneurial nature or on the contrary, a creator of inventions whose recognition belongs elsewhere but an Engineer amonst many, whose work should be recognised.

        <h3 id="headline"> A short biography</h3>
        <p>
          Born in modern-day Croatia in 1856, Tesla was one of five children mothered by Djuka Mandic, a woman known to have invented small household appliances in her spare time. Despite being commended by the dean of his higher educational facility, Tesla failed to graduate and later moved to Budapest, working for a telegraph company. Here he perfected a telephone repeater, an electronic device that recieves and retransmits signals. Having successfully acquired a job in Paris, Tesla gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering at the Société Electrique Edison. In 1884, Tesla was employed by Edison Machine works, an organisation in the states. After 6 months, he quit, describing the bonus offered by management as a 'practical joke'. Thereafter, Tesla worked on some of his most influential inventions, including the <a href="#inventions">Tesla coil and the induction motor. </a>Before his death at the age of 86, Tesla obtained around 300 patents and wrote a number of books and articles.

        <p>Hippolyte Pixii builds the first alternator, a device with a rotating magnet. Unaware of the uses of his creation as the primary focus was on DC devices.

        <p>Lucien Gaulard develops transformers and the power transmission system. The demonstration includes a 25 mile trolley with step down transformers that allows low power Edison incandescent lights to light the path along with arc lamps.</p>

        <p>George Westinghouse orders a Siemens AC generator and a Gaulard and Gibbs transformer, allowing William Stanley to experiment with the system. Stanley built the first practical induction coil, one that could handle large amounts of power and was easy to manifacture.</p>

  The spread of AC systems suffered a push back in late 1887 by Thomas Edison (a proponent of direct current). Edison attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the "war of the currents".</p>
