# My Tribute page 
Basing this page on Nikola Tesla was primarily due to my sympathetic nature towards the way he was treated by Thomas Edison. After reading of his challenges in a book, I was surprised with the scientific community; one that I thought was more collaborative than competitive in nature. Despite the small audience (the school of code community), I wanted others to see how Tesla, being a victim of Edison's authoritative behaviour was able to achieve so much but, I became aware of much more once the research began.

Through discussions and the use of the web I was aware the misconceptions surrounding this topic and having done my PGCE year, wanted to address them .The book ['The innovators'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Inventors-Hackers-Geniuses-Revolution/dp/1471138801) by Walter Isaacson influenced my decision to base my page on the importance of collaboration rather than a sole individual. Thus the page not only tells the audience of the history of alternating current but of my discoveries too.

A valuable lesson I had learnt whilst focusing on the content was to look at the situation from an outsiders perspective. Tesla was often portrayed as the victim of Edison but was Edison just being a wise businessman? Was he doing what many individuals would do today in order to succeed, and if so, was he really at fault? Focussing on what the media may have exasperated with the incentive of attracting readers is not important. What is, is recognising what these individuals contributed to the wider society.  

Aside from the science, coding this page has an equal mix of frustration and joy. So I can end on a positive note, I will begin with the former. My anger stemmed from overlooking the difficulties one could face with CSS and HTML. I can assure you positioning elements is not easy and having to eliminate the browsers default textboxes and create your own just to change the colour does seem rather tedious. That however is the nature of software development. Some aspects are seamless and others require what may appear as a lengthy process. I can only put this down to the nature of being human and trying to understand the language of computers is one I am consistency working towards. Amongst these challenges and feeling of losing of sensation in your buttocks after having sat at your desk for too long, is somewhat worthwhile when you solve the problem and share your work with family and friends.

A few ways I would like to improve my tribute page: 

* DRY - my submisson is repetitive or at least longer than it should be in various places - mainly in CSS but in JS too. 
* Use of JS - A webpage that is more responsive to user input. 
* Display - I am far from creative but I hope by being exposed to others ideas I can build some of my own.
