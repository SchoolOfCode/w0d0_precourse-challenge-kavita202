# My Tribute page 
Basing this page on Nikola Tesla was based on my sympathy towards the way he was treated by Thomas Edison. Having a scientific background, I was surprised to discover the competitive nature of the community and how influential social hierarchy was and still is. Despite the small audience (the school of code community), I wanted others to see how Tesla, being a victim of Edison's authoritative behaviour, was able to achieve so much. Nevertheless, I became aware of much more once the research began.

Through discussions and the use of the web I was aware of the misconceptions surrounding this topic and having recently completed my PGCE, recognised the importance of addressing them. The book ['The innovators'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovators-Inventors-Hackers-Geniuses-Revolution/dp/1471138801) by Walter Isaacson influenced my decision to base the page on the importance of collaboration rather than a sole individual. Thus the page not only tells the audience of the history of alternating current but of my discoveries whilst completing the task. 

A valuable lesson learnt whilst focusing on the content was to analyse the situation from an outsider's perspective. Tesla was often portrayed as the victim of Edison but few recognised Edison's entrepreneurial skill. It is a world that revolves around business and as humans, our biggest incentive is  financial. Were and are there still many individuals who would replicate such behaviour and if so, are they wrong? Are we just aware of this for the purpose of infotainment?  Focusing on what the media may have exasperated with the incentive of attracting readers is not important. What is, is recognising what these individuals contributed to the wider society.  

Aside from the science, coding this page has an equal mix of frustration and joy. So I can end on a positive note, I will begin with the former. My anger stemmed from overlooking the difficulties one could face with CSS and HTML. I can assure you positioning elements is not easy and having to eliminate the browsers default textboxes and create your own just to change the colour does seem rather tedious. That however is the nature of software development. Some aspects are seamless and others require what may appear as a lengthy process. I can only put this down to the nature of being human and trying to understand the language of computers is one I am consistently working towards. These challenges and the feeling of losing sensation in your buttocks after having sat at your desk for too long, is somewhat worthwhile when you look back and reflect on the progress you have made.


A few ways I would like to improve my tribute page: 

* DRY - my submisson is repetitive or at least longer than it should be in various places - mainly in CSS but in JS too. The former will be updated using SASS. 
* Use of JS - A webpage that is more responsive to user input. 
* Display - I am far from creative but I hope by being exposed to others ideas I can build some of my own.
